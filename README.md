# Connect4

# Game Basics
In case you've never played, Connect 4 is like an oversized version of tic-tac-toe. The game board is 7 columns and 6 rows and players take turns dropping checkers into the board to try and get 4 in a row. Usually the board is blue, and the checkers are red and yellow.



# Requirements
- 2 player game. 1 player can be AI or you can alternate between 2 human players.
- Must determine wins - same color checker has 4 in a row
- Must determine ties - game board full with no winner
- Able to reset game after a win or tie
- Checkers must go to the lowest spot possible in a selected column. They shouldn't "float". Gravity, it's the law.
